"""
Euclidean Algorithm:
    Start with the two initial numbers a and b.
    Do a division with remainder: a=q0â‹…b+r0
    Use the remainder (r0) and the divisor (b) from the last calculation to set up the next calculation: b=q1â‹…r0+r1
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the remainder is 0.
    The second last remainder calculated is the greatest common divisor.

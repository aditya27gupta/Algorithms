"""
Radix Sort Algorithm:
    An array with non negative integers that needs to be sorted.
    A two dimensional array with index 0 to 9 to hold values with the current radix in focus.
    A loop that takes values from the unsorted array and places them in the correct position in the two dimensional radix array.
    A loop that puts values back into the initial array from the radix array.
    An outer loop that runs as many times as there are digits in the highest value.
